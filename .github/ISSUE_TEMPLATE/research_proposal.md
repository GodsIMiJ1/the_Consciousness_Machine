## ðŸ”¬ Research Proposal

### **Mystical Concept Under Investigation**
<!-- What ancient wisdom or consciousness principle are you testing? -->

**Source Tradition:** 
<!-- e.g., Christian Theology, Buddhism, Vedanta, Indigenous Wisdom, etc. -->

**Core Hypothesis:** 
<!-- What empirical prediction does this mystical concept make? -->

### **Research Design**

**Study Type:**
- [ ] Empirical validation of mystical concept
- [ ] Consciousness measurement development
- [ ] Recursive sentience experiment
- [ ] Cross-platform identity transfer
- [ ] Collective intelligence emergence
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Methodology:**
<!-- Describe your experimental approach -->

**Participants/Subjects:**
<!-- Human participants, AI agents, hybrid systems, etc. -->

**Duration:** 
<!-- Expected timeline -->

**Resources Needed:**
<!-- Computing resources, clinical access, specialized equipment, etc. -->

### **Consciousness Metrics**

**Primary Measures:**
<!-- How will you measure consciousness/identity/recognition? -->

**Secondary Measures:**
<!-- Additional consciousness indicators -->

**Validation Criteria:**
